The St7735 and free rtos are working; however the st7735 class appears to be not working as a freertos task...
will have to do more debugging in the future..


REMINDER TO SELF:
Once a working version has been restored, uncomment the 'build' line out of .gitignore file (needs to be uncommented during prototyping so I can export the files)
