READ ME is WIP; Will start a github pages to link to the appropriate blog posts, etc. for the project.
TODO:
-start a seperate repo to encapsulate my own st7735/ili library with seamless freertos usage... ; CYW43 can stay within the pockpet (no additional seperate repo; not as versatile, can't be used in seperate use cases...)
-setup the github pages and research the proper syntax to be used on readme's and on ghp; setup a blog system for internal usage and to increase output.
-perhaps setup a kanban board and enable it to be used by other devs; low proprity and not very useful for a solo dev....
-shred and be cool
