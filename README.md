# Welcome to the Ampalaya Branch!!!!!

## Our Goals:
Ampalaya is my study into embedded/iot systems and the art of combining microcontroller routines
and leveraging client-server infastructure to make a robust and well-designed product.

Ampalaya is still in breadboard phase. Once the firmware for all of my peripherals is working to my satisfaction, I'll make a test pcb.

*Hardware-PCB fabrication
*IOT/Wifi handling; CLIENT (pockpet-side) and SERVER (aws???)
*Writing drivers for lcd screens, push button interfaces, and network handlers
*An opportunity to learn how to make pixel art
